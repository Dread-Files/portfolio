			<p>Gray wolves are canines with long bushy tails that are often
				black-tipped. Coat color is typically a mix of gray and brown with buffy facial
				markings and undersides, but the color can vary from solid white to brown
				or black. Gray wolves look somewhat like a large German Shepherd.</p>
